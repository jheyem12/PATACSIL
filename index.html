          <b>PROJECT PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION</b><br><br>
          An Information Management System that will promote the SK and its program of Barangay Talaga which will gain the trust of the youth and encourage them to actively engage in the SK activities. The system aims to provide a platform for SK officials to manage their activities, and promote youth participation in governance. The system can help solve various problems, including insufficient data for decision-making, and limited youth participation in governance.

      </div>
      <br><p class="desc">
        <b>PROJECT PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION</b><br><br>
          The system will be a centralized and structured method of maintaining 
          data, enabling simple information retrieval, reporting, and analysis which can contribute 
          to the overall improvement of decision-making as well as the tracking and monitoring of 
          the gasoline consumption of vehicles under the jurisdiction of the Rizal government. This 
          approach will also overcome the existing challenges of paper-based systems with poor 
          data organization, absence of accurate information, and restricted accountability and 
          transparency.
